# sqlalchemy-challenge
This repo contains a demonstration of Python and SQLAlchemy climate analysis and data exploration of a climate database. All of the analysis is completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

To present the data analysis, a Flask API server was developed via the app.py file.
